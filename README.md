# secure-checkout-shared-cart

This project is focused on creating a Unified Secure Checkout and Shared Cart plugin for WordPress. The plugin will securely handle the checkout process and enable shared carts functionality, including a shortcode to display shared carts.

Key features:
- Secure handling of checkout processes.
- Shared carts functionality, allowing users to share their shopping carts with others.
- A shortcode that enables the display of shared carts on any page or post.
- A REST API endpoint to manage shared cart details, including retrieving and updating cart contents.
- Integration with WordPress's AJAX handler for dynamic cart content display and updates.

The plugin will be implemented in PHP, utilizing WordPress's hooks and APIs, including the WP_REST_Controller for REST API endpoints and the wp_ajax_ actions for handling AJAX requests.
